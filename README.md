# Feedback Analysis

An app where students can give feedback about their teachers. A Java Swings software where the admin can view the feedbacks and can view a bar-graph of the average of all the feedbacks for each teacher and can even compare teachers.   

This project was developed in a hackathon named *API* (Analyse Plan Implement) organised by DJ ACM.

The problem statement was to have a platform where the students could give the feedback of their teachers. This feedback was to be recorded and an analysis was to be shown to the admin.

The platform consisted of two main things:
- An app where the students would give their feedbacks
- A desktop software for the admin to view the analysis

**App** [(Android)](https://github.com/anerishah97)
- Based on the class and div chosen by the student the list of the teachers(lectures, practicals) were displayed in the app
- The student *not revealing* his identity could give the honest feedback for the teacher.

**Desktop Software** [(Java Swings)](https://github.com/MitP97/feedback_analysis)
- The admin was supposed to choose the teacher(s) for whom he wants to see the analysis.
- A bar graph was shown to depict the results of the feedback given by the students.
